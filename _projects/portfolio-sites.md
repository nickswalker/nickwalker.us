In addition to this website, I also maintain my [brother](https://alexwalker.co) and [mother's](https://ineswalker.com) portfolios. Jekyll makes it easy for them to author content, and GitHub helps automate the deployment process (with the help of a little deployment tool I [adapted](https://github.com/nickswalker/simple-php-git-deploy)).
