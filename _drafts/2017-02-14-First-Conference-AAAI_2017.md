I got to attend [AAAI-17](http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai17.php) in San Fransisco this past week. It was my first academic conference and I had only a vague idea what the experience would be like. Every conference is different, but

## Tutorials

The first two days were wholly dedicated to four-hour, lecture-style "tutorials". Most of these were led by two or three researchers who had signficant experience with some subtopic, like logic programming or optimization. There was a good range of topics, and I appreciated the chance to get exposed to ideas from across the field. Attendance was pretty light this year, likely because they were scheduled against a number of industry-sponsored events. I do imagine established researchers grow jaded to the value of sitting in classes for a weekend, but students should take advantage of the opportunity.

In particular, I enjoyed [Interactive Machine Learning](http://interactiveml.net) and [Paper of the Future](http://scientificpaperofthefuture.org/training-materials). Both covered topics that aren't accessible via coursework at UT.

## Technical Sessions

The meat of the conference was the technical sessions. AAAI has tracks for just about any AI subdiscipline, so the four weekdays of the conference were packed with a hodge-podge of one and half hour long blocks of thematically-related talks from authors. A lot of these were pretty bad. Many speakers tried to fit too much information into their 15 minutes or focused on definitions and minutia that wasn't essential to the core result of their work. Though ostensibly these presentations are about the work that was done, they must also sell the audience on reading the paper so they can learn more and hopefully build on and cite it in the future. The best presentations were faithful to the contents of the work, but also made a clear case for why the audience should take the time to look more carefully at the work later.

## Posters

The format changes from year to year, but this year all papers were assigned to either a talk (to occur in a technical session) or a poster. All posters for a given day would be available for viewing starting at 6 in the evening. The organizers arranged to have dinner (and amazing desserts) served, so these showings had a lot of traffic. I enjoyed getting to talk to people about their work one-on-one, and I got a lot of practice explaining our work as well.

Because there's food and drinks out, this also the best schmoozing/networking part of the day. It's too soon to tell, but I feel like meeting some people during these sessions was the most valuable thing I got out of the conference.

## Other Activities

Each morning and evening, distinguised researchers gave invited talks on their work. These were typically fairly accessible and interesting, and much more polished than most of the other presentations happening during the week.

There were a number of industry talks, though most of these were just thinly veiled recruiting talks with little technical value. The career fair was great because all of the companies there were interested in recruiting people with exactly the attendees' background, a pretty rare opportunity for the focussed job seeker.

The [Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI)](http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/IAAI/iaai17.php) conference was colocated with AAAI this year, and a standard registration was good for both. There were a lot of great sessions where researchers or industry folks showed off impressive practical work.

There were a few student activities throughout the conference. I got to eat lunch with [Sven Koenig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Koenig_(computer_scientist)) through *Lunch With a Fellow*, and I met lots of impressive students (including many more undergrads than I was expecting) at the student reception.

## The City

After the conference, I had a couple of days to see the city. I did many of the touristy things (Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, California Academy of Sciences, Chinatown). It was also cool to visit Union Square (Uniqlo!) and see all of the landmarks that crop up in conversations about San Francisco.
