I got to attend [AAAI-17]() in San Fransisco this past week. It was my first academic conference. I didn't really know what to expect

## Tutorials

The first two days of AAAI are wholly dedicated to four-hour, lecture-style "tutorials". Most of these were led by two or three researchers who had signficant experience with some subtopic, like logic programming or optimization. There was a good range of topics, and I appreciated the chance to get exposed to ideas from across the field. Attendance was pretty light this year, likely because they were scheduled against a number of industry-sponsored events. I do imagine established researchers grow jaded to the value of sitting in classes for a weekend, but students should take advantage of the opportunity.

In particular, two tutorials were very valuable to me. Interactive Machine Learning and Paper of the Future.

## Technical Sessions

AAAI is a general conference
