## Usage

This calculator lets you see paces, finish times and lap times for arbitrary distances run on a track. It supports both standard and non-standard track lengths, including Seattle's own [Drumheller Fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumheller_Fountain). It assumes you are running in lane one.

Click on the column header to set it as the "basis"; values in this column will be nice, round numbers, and other columns will be calculated _based_ on this column. For example, if you set the basis to "Lap (s)", you can find a memorable lap time to target for your intervals or race.
