bio: I'm Nick, a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle. I work on human-robot interaction and interactive machine learning with the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu). Previously, I was a student at UT Austin, where I worked on transfer learning and service robots with the [Building Wide Intelligence](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/) project and helped students in the Autonomous Intelligent Robotics research stream. Otherwise, I'm a violinist, [photographer](https://flickr.com/photos/nickwalker-us), and [runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35387878).
