bio: I'm Nick, a computer science student at UT Austin. I research reinforcement learning with the [Building Wide Intelligence](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/) group and help students in the [Autonomous Intelligent Robotics](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jsinapov/teaching/cs378_fall2016/) research stream. My interests include human computer-interaction, robotics and interactive machine learning. Outside of class, I'm a violinist, [photographer](/photos) and foil fencer. I maintain a number of neat projects.
