bio: I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle. I work on human-robot interaction and general-purpose service robotics with the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu). Most of my research deals with human-robot communication, either [implicit](https://nickwalker.us/publications/walker2021attributions) or [explicit](https://nickwalker.us/publications/jiang2019icaps). Previously, I was a student at UT Austin, where I worked on service robots with the [Building Wide Intelligence](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/) project. Otherwise, I'm a [photographer](https://flickr.com/photos/nickwalker-us) and [runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35387878).
