bio: I'm Nick, a computer science student at the University of Washington. My interests include robotics, human-robot interaction, and interactive machine learning. Previously, I was a student at UT Austin, where I worked on transfer learning and service robots with the [Building Wide Intelligence](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/) and helped students in the Autonomous Intelligent Robotics research stream. Outside of class, I'm a violinist, [photographer](https://flickr.com/photos/nickwalker-us), and foil fencer. I also maintain a number of projects.
