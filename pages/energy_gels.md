Endurance athletes consume highly concentrated carbohydrate solutions because it maintains blood glucose levels and spares [limited accessible energy sources](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fnutrit%2Fnuy001). There are [many "energy gel" sports nutrition products](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xuguang-Zhang-2/publication/277081684_Extreme_Variation_of_Nutritional_Composition_and_Osmolality_of_Commercially_Available_Carbohydrate_Energy_Gel/links/557971f508aeb6d8c020255c/Extreme-Variation-of-Nutritional-Composition-and-Osmolality-of-Commercially-Available-Carbohydrate-Energy-Gel.pdf) to choose from.

They can be costly, anywhere from $1 per 25g of carbohydrates to as much as [$3.5 per 25g for high-end solutions](https://www.maurten.com/products/us/gel-100-box-us). That means spending $8-$28 to cover a marathon, and maybe $50-$150 per marathon training block on gels if you're practicing nutrition regularly.

Fortunately, it's easy to make nutrition at home. The basic idea is **to target a 3:1 glucose to fructose ratio**, then add water to reach a manageable concentration.

DIY means you can easily add caffeine and salt, or substitute a carb source. And you can use the containers of your choice. I am partial to [100ml flip-cap plastic pouches](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=100ml+plastic+flasks+concealable) which fit in most shorts' gel pockets. For workouts, I dump the ingredients in a bottle as a sports drink.

## Recipe

This calculator takes your desired [carb-type ratio](#glucosefructose-ratio), [osmolality](#osmolality-and-isotonicity) and any [desired ingredients](#which-ingredients-should-i-use), then optimizes for low mass. Only checked ingredients will be considered in the calculation, but they may be ignored if they are not needed to reach the desired characteristics. Heavy syrups will be left out in favor of pure powders unless you specifically exclude the powders or set amounts for the syrups. If your entered ingredients or amounts can't meet your target ratio, the calculator will tell you. Hover over ingredient names to see their glucose/fructose ratio, and hover over ml to see oz.

1. Add viscous ingredients (e.g. syrup, honey) to water and mix until dissolved. 
2. Add powdered ingredients and mix until dissolved. 

Keeps for 2-3 days in a refrigerator.

### Which ingredients should I use?

Refined ingredients are more expensive and generally have to be bought online, but you need them for low osmolality and lower volume/mass. Honey and other natural products are cheaper and more widely available, but will require more water to reach a manageable osmolality. 

If you're using dry ingredients, use [maltodextrin](#maltodextrin). If you aren't, brown rice syrup is useful as a glucose source because it contains so little fructose, unlike the other viscous ingredients.

### How many carbs per hour?

The recommendation for events longer than an hour is 60g per hour, and there's [evidence of performance and recovery benefits for using as much as 120g of carbohydrate an hour](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1367) in elite endurance athletes. Tolerance varies between individuals and is trainable.

### Glucose:fructose ratio

Glucose and fructose [use separate metabolic pathways](https://www.mysportscience.com/post/2015/05/14/carb-mixes-and-benefits), and taking both at the same time [helps keep carbs available in your system](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP277116). The recipe defaults to a low amount of fructose compared to common recommendations of 2:1 or 1:1 ratios because fructose is not that important until you're able to saturate the glucose pathway. Large amounts of fructose can also be unpleasantly sweet.

### Osmolality and isotonicity

[Osmolality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration) is the concentration of a solution. It is measured in milliosmole per liter (mOsm/L). A solution is isotonic if it has the same osmolality as blood plasma, ~295mOsm/L. If the solution is too concentrated, it'll cause GI stress as fluids are pulled in. If it's too dilute, it'll pass before full absorption.

 The only way to change osmolality for a given mass of carbohydrate is to use fewer particles (e.g. use heavier carbohydrates, like [maltodextrin](#maltodextrin), which are still quickly metabolized) or to add more water. The default 3400 mOsm/L for this recipe is high, though lower than [that of most commercial products](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277081684_Extreme_Variation_of_Nutritional_Composition_and_Osmolality_of_Commercially_Available_Carbohydrate_Energy_Gel). Making the solution isotonic requires adding so much fluid as to make it impractical (and doesn't align with fluid consumption of [high-performing athletes either](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22450589/)).

### Maltodextrin

[Maltodextrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltodextrin) is a large molecule consisting of chains of glucose and is created by chemically processing starch. Its less sweet and crystallization-prone than sugar, but also less viscous in solution than a starch. It is quickly broken down into glucose inside the body, and is typically easier to tolerate in large quantities. All of this is why it's the primary carb source in commercial gels.

The length of the glucose chain is [variable depending on the chemical process and starches used](https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/specialty-nutrients/making-the-most-of-maltodextrins). Anything between 2 and 20 glucose groups (degree of polymerization) are sold alike. Longer chains are preferable as they'll result in a lower osmolality. You can contact the manufacturer to get the number, but generally longer chain versions will take longer to dissolve in water and will be barely sweet. The calculator assumes a degree of polymerization of 10, since I was quoted 10-12 by a representative of the company I use.

### Does it need to be fully dissolved?

Check fully dissolved if you want a sports drink. If you don't want a sports drink, the recipe will give you a gooey paste. It's not the same as a commercial gel...because there's no [gelling agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent).

### Flavors

Citric acid or lemon juice work well, and in such small quantities that the effect on concentration is negligible.

### Caffeine

The [recommendation](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fnu15010148) is 3-6mg caffeine per kilogram body mass, spread through the window starting an hour before the event to an hour before completion. Caffeine powder is dangerous and easily mishandled. Save yourself the trouble; buy capsules and dump the contents in as needed.

### Carb loading

You can also use this gel/drink recipe in the lead up to a big event for an easy-to-tolerate carb load. See [this helpful calculator](https://www.featherstonenutrition.com/carb-loading) for an idea of how many carbs and when to eat them.
