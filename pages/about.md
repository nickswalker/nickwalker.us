Nick Walker earned his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he worked in Maya Cakmak's 
    [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu). His research seeks to reduce the difficulty of making robots that people can understand by augmenting existing behaviors based on models of human inference. During [his PhD]({% details_link walker2025dissertation %}), he studied problems
   [balancing the tradeoff between task performance and expressivity]({% details_link walker2021attributions %}) to [how to automatically narrate complex robot behaviors]({% details_link wang2024doing %}), and he has published results in numerous IEEE and ACM scholarly conferences. In 2022, Nick interned with Claudia PÃ©rez D'Arpino at [Nvidia's Seattle Robotics Lab](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/) to work on [intuitive interfaces for telemanipulation]({% details_link walker2024explicit %}). A part of this project [won an HRI Best Paper award in 2024]({% post_url 2024-03-15-3d-mice-best-paper %}). His research was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. While a student, Nick led the organization of the first [Northwest Robotics Symposium](https://nwrsymposium.github.io).

Nick earned a Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin where he worked on service and domestic robots in Peter Stone's
[Building Wide Intelligence](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/){: data-goatcounter-click="ext-bwi"} project. He was part of the [Austin Villa@Home RoboCup team](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~AustinVilla/) that [placed 3rd]({% post_url 2017-08-28-robocup-2017-success %}) in 2017 and [won best-poster in 2018]({% post_url 2018-06-21-dspl-best-poster-award %}). Nick earned honors as a [Polymath in the College of Natural Sciences]({% post_url 2014-08-25-polymathic-scholar %}), was recognized as a [Dean's Honored Graduate]({% post_url 2018-03-27-deans-honored-graduate %}) and was selected to [speak at commencement]({% post_url 2018-05-19-commencement-address %}).

Nick is also a [photographer](https://flickr.com/photos/nickwalker-us){: data-goatcounter-click="ext-flickr.com-bio"} and 
    [runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/35387878){: data-goatcounter-click="ext-strava.com"}. He directs the annual [Drumheller Marathon]({% link _projects/drumheller-marathon.md %}) and [Light Rail Relay]({% link _projects/light-rail-relay.md %}) endurance running events in Seattle organized under [Race Condition Running](https://raceconditionrunning.com). His experiences with urban running have led him to contribute writing to The Urbanist.
