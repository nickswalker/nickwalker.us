  When [Mayfield Robotics](https://www.bosch-business-innovations.com/media/downloads/mayfield_robotics_exit_story_2mb_update.pdf) shut down and sent us a couple Kuris, I set out on reverse engineering so we could put them to work. I deobfuscated internal code and developed examples. We (and several other labs) used these tools to power later projects with Kuri.
