description: >
  Teleoperating robots in cluttered environments is hard. The most commonly explored way of assisting operators is to have a sort of predictive trajectory completion, but this breaks down when there are many possible goals and the one you predict is wrong. We explore an alternative "pointing" based interface. We show that it reduces operator workload and improves performance in cluttered environments.
