description: |
  A distance relay along Seattle's Link Light Rail, with exchanges at each station. I organize and direct the event. Participation has grown to over 100 runners. The open, unmarked 38 mile urban course means the map is critical. In 2024, I integrated live train arrivals information and built custom tiles from Openstreetmap data to include water fountains, restrooms and other runner-focused features.
