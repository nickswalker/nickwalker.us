## University of Washington

These include UW's brand colors as well as some nice compliments which you can use in supporting figures or call outs.
Vector versions of the university branding as well as the CSE branding are included too.

CSE's large format printers [use 36 inch wide rolls](https://www.cs.washington.edu/lab/printing/poster-printer), so these
examples are based on that limitation. The type sizes are generous. They'll still read well if you need to [shrink
a bit](https://docupub.com/pdfresize/) to fit A0. 

* [Landscape Template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1DZKQcmavMqciiomEa7wPaktpdcdkrYinKxer4hJRi_g) (41" x 36")
<!--* [Portrait Template]() (36" x 41")-->

## The University of Texas at Austin


UTCS's large format printer is [limited to 34 inches](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/poster-help) along one dimension, so these
examples are based on that limitation. Note that the CNS printer in Painter (mostly used by undergraduates for things like the Undergraduate Reserach Forum) has a much larger maximum dimension of 42 inches.

* [Portrait Template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/13LM8oObE-lhoYUpMPPw3s7USy35XNZhxyBlAzl7I-aY) (34" x 46")

## FAQ

### Why use Google Draw?

Because its collaborative editing works well, mostly.

Unfortunately, it [doesn't make it easy](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/107705) to properly include vector graphics, doesn't let you add hyperlinks to the output PDF, doesn't have many high-quality typeface choices available, and still suffers from some all around jank.
But at least you won't be juggling PowerPoint or Keynote files around, and it's of course a far superior experience to using something like Beamer.

### How do I use them?

1. Open a link
2. _File_ > _Make a copy_

Once you need to work with the layout:

* _View_ > _Guides_ > _Show guides_

Guides legend:
<!-- TODO: Colored dots here -->
* Red guides are for margin. Respect the margin.
* Magenta guides are for inter-column space. You can let images extend into this space, and bullets **should** hang out here.
* Green guides are for text bounds.

### How do I use them tastefully?

* Stick to the given font sizes.
* Don't waste ink with unnecessary dark backgrounds; it increases the odds that something goes wrong with the print (e.g. smearing, streaking).
* Use the highest resolution assets you have access to.
  * If you have a vector figure or logo, use [this process](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/107705) to make sure it is inserted without loss of quality
* Use the correct university and department branding.
* Aim to develop your own brand, not your university's. Don't pull so heavily on the official brand guidelines that your poster looks like university communications, because it isn't.
* Use branding that'll land with the audience. If people aren't likely recognize your lab logo or name, make sure the institutional branding is more prominent.
