We spent some time thinking about how to build some recent advances in neural natural language understanding into a system
that could be useful for a general-purpose service robot.
The approach strikes a nice balance between flexibility, performance, and ease of implementation.
I'll present {% cite_details walker2019robocup --text the paper %} at this year's [RoboCup Symposium](https://2019.robocup.org/downloads/program/2019RCS-Program_v12.pdf) in Australia.


Yuqian and I also put down some of {% cite_details walker2019planrob --text thoughts on what the desirable features of a GPSR planning system are %}, a nice complement to our {% cite_details jiang2019icaps --text other work %} to appear at ICAPS.
