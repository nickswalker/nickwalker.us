Four runners became the first Drumheller Marathoners at [this year's race](https://raceconditionrunning.com/drumheller-marathon-24), joined by a record 21 half marathoners. Officially, 42 people ran 4382 laps around the fountain, and that doesn't include laps from the many who didn't register.

The [course](https://certifiedroadraces.com/certificate/?type=m&id=3255), which I measured again this year, becomes one of only three recognized marathons in Seattle, and the smallest footprint road marathon in the United States.
