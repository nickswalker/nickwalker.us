I updated my [DIY energy gel calculator](https://nickwalker.us/energy-gels) to allow for mixing and matching a variety of ingredients. You can target a particular sugar-type ratio and the calculator will figure out what amounts to use for you. If you want an idea of how much water to add so it won't hurt your stomach, the calculator also shows the [concentration (or _osmolalilty_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration) of your mix. 
I've included cliff notes on the science behind the calculator for the curious.
