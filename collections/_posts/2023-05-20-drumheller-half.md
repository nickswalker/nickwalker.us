I measured and [certified](https://certifiedroadraces.com/certificate/?type=m&id=2487) a half marathon course around UW's iconic [Drumheller Fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumheller_Fountain) for the second running of our fountain event. Altogether, 32 people ran 2263 laps around the fountain. Unlike most half marathons (or even most tracks), this course is available for anyone to run at any time.

Also on the books now; the [Evergreen Point Floating Bridge West calibration course](https://certifiedroadraces.com/certificate/?type=c&id=512), a safe, accessible 320m straight for calibrating bike odometers.
