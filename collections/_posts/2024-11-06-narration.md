Our [first stab]({% details_link wang2024doing %}) at turning robot experience into a coherent narrative is at [CoRL](https://corl.org) this week. Zihan put up a [great overview here](https://sites.google.com/view/real-world-robot-narration/home) and included a ton of detail in the appendices. We hope that others will pick up on similar applications of LLMs as summarizers and narrators for robot experience.

Also appearing, a [workshop paper]({% details_link gan2024can %}) thinking about how LLMs might help developers edit robot state machines.
