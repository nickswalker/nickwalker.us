> The transistor is one of the most essential components of modern technology. Developed in the late 1940s and early 1950â€™s, this device enabled scientists to amplify and redirect electrical power, a crucial innovation in the field of electronics. Nick Walker, a student at Communication Arts High School in San Antonio, created a video for Texas History Day narrating the big history of this little device.

My [documentary](https://vimeo.com/57908212) placed first in the Texas History Day Fair, and seventh in the National History Day Fair. To my knowledge, this is the most successful entry from a Communications Arts student to date.
