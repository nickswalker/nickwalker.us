Good year for UTCS. Departments each get to nominate four students. Three 
of us received honorable mentions and the fourth won the award.

Past UTCS recipients include [Yuqian Jiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuqian-jiang-131b4971/) (HM 2016) and [Franziska Roesner](https://www.franziroesner.com) (Finalist 2008).
