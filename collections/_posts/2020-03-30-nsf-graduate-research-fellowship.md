From [the solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program/nsf18-573/solicitation):

> The program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students who are pursuing full-time research-based master's and doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or in STEM education. The GRFP provides three years of support over a five-year fellowship period for the graduate education of individuals who have demonstrated their potential for significant research achievements in STEM or STEM education.


Good news in a bad news time. [By my count](https://www.research.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=sort&page=11), there are 7 University of Washington Computer Science awardees, and 3 of us are UT Austin alumni.
