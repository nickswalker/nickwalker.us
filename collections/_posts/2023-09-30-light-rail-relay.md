Light Rail Relay, a marathon relay along Seattle's Link Light Rail, welcomed external teams (that is, clubs that aren't [Race Condition Running](https://raceconditionrunning.com)) for the first time. Thank you to our friends at Google and the [Rainier Beach Running Club](https://rbrunclub.wordpress.com/) for joining. We hope to see you again next year!

This was my third time organizing the event, but my first time [running the whole route](https://www.strava.com/activities/9952252870) at once. It's lovely way to see Seattle.
