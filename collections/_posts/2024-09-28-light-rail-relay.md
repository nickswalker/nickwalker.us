Light Rail Relay---the marathon relay along Seattle's Link Light Rail [that I organize]({% link _projects/light-rail-relay.md %})---had its biggest year yet: more than 120 runners across 11 teams and 2 solo participants. Thank you team captains and runners for making it a success.

This year, I [ran solo](https://www.strava.com/activities/12527120633), with company for the first 13 miles (thanks, Han!). The new Lynnwood extension added 8 extra miles, making the event Seattle's second organized road 50K (more like 55-60k) and quite a challenging one at that.
