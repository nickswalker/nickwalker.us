We needed to put a Mayfield Kuri into the halls of our building for a study, but it turned out to be no small feat. We settled on a system that had the robot roam around and occasionally ping us for help when it needed to charge. It's a pattern to consider if you find yourself wanting to run a user study with a robot that can't navigate autonomously. Check out [the paper]({% details_link nanavati2022wandering %}), and don't miss the demo on the [project page](https://wandering.nickwalker.us).
