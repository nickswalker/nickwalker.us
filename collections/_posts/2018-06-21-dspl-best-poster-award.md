I was fortunate to get to work with UT Austin Villa one more time for my last summer in Texas.
[Yuqian Jiang](https://yuqianjiang.us), [Justin Hart](http://justinhart.net) and I spent quite some time putting [a poster](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3249235)
together describing the team's research direction, and I am grateful that the team let me present it in Montreal.
