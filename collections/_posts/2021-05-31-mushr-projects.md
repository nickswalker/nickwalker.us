I helped put on UW's undergrad robotics class this spring, working as one of several TAs to revamp the [course projects](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse478/21sp/projects/) for a fully virtual, simulation-only format. Thanks to the incredible platform and software work from [the MuSHR team](https://mushr.io), we were able to create
a buttery experience. I don't know of any other educational stack that provides high-quality tests and scaffolding that can guide students in implementing a particle filter, controller and planner for a mobile robot---using ROS Noetic and Python 3, no less. All on top of a simulator that's lightweight enough to run smoothly in an Ubuntu VM on just about any laptop. I think the materials and approach here should be _the_ starting place for any class that's trying to get students familiar with the important ideas in autonomous robotics and robot software.
