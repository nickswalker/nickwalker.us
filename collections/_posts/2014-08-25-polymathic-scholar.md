Excited to head to UT Austin, where I'll be a "Polymathic Scholar" as a part of one of the College of Natural Science's thesis-based honors programs.

From the program:

> Polymaths combine a commitment to the sciences with compelling interests beyond them. ... What they have in common are interesting questions---questions that require expertise from different branches of knowledge, _interdisciplinary questions_. And a major research university like UT-Austin is the ideal setting for answering them.


**Update May 20th, 2018**: I graduated from UT and the Polymathic Scholars program this semester and am extremely grateful for my time there. The program describes its students as "the Renaissance people in the College of Natural Sciences, [whose] signature trait is curiosity." That's it to a tee.
