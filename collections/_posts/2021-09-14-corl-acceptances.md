To appear as posters at the [Conference on Robot Learning](https://www.robot-learning.org) in November (virtually, I would guess):
* A paper describing [how a robot can shape perceptions of its motion while doing a task](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UIaodSPHNFN). I'm happy that we were able to model this problem cleanly, and especially happy that our method works even with a tricky domain coverage. iRobot, if you're reading this, get in touch ðŸ˜‰
* Some new work describing [how you can get a robot to make natural-seeming back-channels](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0WDtVJVwBcf) (nods, in this paper) based on human speech signals and a head-pose estimate. All it took was a fairly small amount of human-human interaction data, and the models are small enough that you can run them on real robots.
