After [Maya got to see RoboCup@Home up close](https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/news/2019/03/robocup-fellows), we decided to field a team for 2020. [Homeskies](https://robocup.cs.washington.edu) will be UW's first @Home team, and comes 16 years after [UW last participated](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/Aibo/). See you in Bordeaux!
