The ASUW Student Senate passed R-30-20, a “Resolution Calling for the Naming of Cascade Lane” which I sponsored. It

> calls for the official naming of the area deemed “Cascade Lane,” the asphalt path from the southeast steps of Red Square that extends to the edge of the concrete path circling Drumheller Fountain. The bill’s sponsor aims to prioritize its repair by first naming the path, which experiences heavy foot traffic and is in need of repair. 

One of the Senate's functions is to find student consensus on university matters, so with this, [Cascade Lane]({% post_url 2024-05-31-cascade-lane %}) becomes the opinion of the student body.
