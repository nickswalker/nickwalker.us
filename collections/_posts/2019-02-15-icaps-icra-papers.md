[Yuqian](https://yuqianjiang.us) and I will have a paper at [ICAPS](https://icaps19.icaps-conference.org/) on "Open World Planning for Service Robots," the first conference publication to come from UT Austin's RoboCup@Home team!

[Jesse](https://jessethomason.com)'s work on improving a robot's semantic parser through interaction was accepted at [ICRA 2019](https://www.icra2019.org/). An earlier {% cite_details thomason18mrhrc --text workshop version %} gives the thrust.
