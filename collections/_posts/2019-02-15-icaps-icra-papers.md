[Yuqian](https://yuqianjiang.us) and I will have a paper at [ICAPS](https://icaps19.icaps-conference.org/) on {% cite_details jiang2019icaps --text "Open World Planning for Service Robots," %} the first conference publication to come from UT Austin's RoboCup@Home team!
We describe how we make plans for user commands that involve references to objects that the robot hasn't seen recently.

[Jesse](https://jessethomason.com)'s work on improving a robot's semantic parser through interaction was accepted at [ICRA 2019](https://www.icra2019.org/).
It's the {% cite_details thomason2019icra --text most complete description of how to build a continually improving robot language understanding system %} to date.
