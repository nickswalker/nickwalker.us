We wrote a [short paper]({% details_link dhat2024mice %}) on our experience using 3D mice to control robot manipulators. It's a useful resource, but [you don't have to take my word for it](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/awards/index.html).

I initially understood how to make the device usable while working at NVIDIA, but the [code I developed there]({% details_link walker2024explicit %}) is tied to the Isaac ecosystem. This paper's implementation is ROS-ready. Once you understand their limitations, 3D mice are pretty handy. They're full 6DOF control in a cheap, widely available, broadly compatible, and mechanically robust package. Every roboticist working on manipulation should keep a 3D mouse around.
