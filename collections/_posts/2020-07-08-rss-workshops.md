Two RSS 2020 workshops I've been helping put together will be held next week. Check out the papers and come to the live sessions for discussions between our great panelists.

* [Closing the Academia to Real-World Gap in Service Robotics](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/rss-2020-service-robots/home): Researchers spend a lot of time thinking about service robots, but there aren't many companies successfully fielding them. What can researchers do to help their work translate? We proposed this topic before the pandemic, but I'm looking forward to hearing thoughts on how things may change for service robots in a world where human-human contact is being minimized.
* [Advances and Challenges in Imitation Learning for Robotics](https://sites.google.com/utexas.edu/rss-2020-imitation-learning/home): Imitation learning remains as hot as ever. We're looking forward to gathering leading researchers in the area to discuss what's next.

Registration is required (but cheap!) to participate in the live events, but we'll be posting recordings after.
