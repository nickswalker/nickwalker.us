There've been many moments over the past few months when I've felt haunted by the things I would rather be doing. An idea floats by---something that in a normal time I'd read about that night, or spend a Saturday making---but that found me totally occupied. I tried batting them away at first, but they'd come back. It was distracting and kind of distressing. It felt like they were my subconscious forcing me to consider that, if I couldn't engage with what my mind actually thought was interesting, maybe I was doing something wrong.

Then I realized that they were only coming back because they didn't want to be forgotten. So I started writing them down, as soon as they'd arrive, one to a sticky note. And they stopped coming back. I got a quiet my mind _and_ a physical manifestation of what I was working toward. There's probably a post about this idea somewhere on 43folders, but I'm writing this anyway in case it finds someone else with the same problem. 

At this point I don't remember much of what's in the pile (it's about a pad and a half, plus some mail I didn't have the bandwidth the deal with), and I've spent [my first couple unoccupied days]({% post_url 2025-03-14-defended-my-phd %}) cleaning my apartment instead of looking through them. But it worked. I'm here, and they're there, ready for tomorrow.
