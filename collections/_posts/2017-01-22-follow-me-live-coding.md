> A command line utility that periodically commits and pushes all changes made in a Git working tree. Perfect for workshops or other live-coding setups where you want to have a live view of your project state available for the audience.

I hacked this together based on my experiences teaching workshops for [MAD](https://txcsmad.com). Works fairly well considering this is not at all what GitHub was designed for.
